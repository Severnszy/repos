# README for Repository `repos`
## The repository
This is my first repository. Unlike most repositories which were used for keeping projects, `repos` is used to keep different kinds of files which have almost nothing to do with each other, kept in separate braches, for instance documents are kept in the `documents` branch.

## The branches in `repos`
* [master](https://github.com/medoric/repos/tree/master)
The master branch. Used for nothing in perticular.
* [applications](https://github.com/medoric/repos/tree/applications)
For keeping applications like `.exe`, `.msi` files etc.
* [compressed-files](https://github.com/medoric/repos/tree/compressed-files)
For keeping compressed files like `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z` files etc.
* [documents](https://github.com/medoric/repos/tree/documents)
For keeping documents. There are some special documents including `.txt` files (text documents) and `.doc`, `.ppt` and `.xls` files (Microsoft Office documents, presentations and spreadsheets). Other files like `.json` files are also kept in the `documents` branch.
* [miscellaneous](https://github.com/medoric/repos/tree/miscellaneous)
For keeping other kinds of files that doesn't seem much appropriate to keep in the other braches.
* [source-codes](https://github.com/medoric/repos/tree/source-codes)
For keeping the source codes of some C++ programs (the programming language I'm currently using). They are not currently kept in the `documents` branch but I'm going to merge them later.
