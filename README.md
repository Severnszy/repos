## Description of the repository
This is my first repository in GitHub. It is used to keep different kinds of files, kept in separate braches, for instance documents are kept in the `documents` branch. Descriptions of each branch are as follows:
* [master](https://github.com/Medoric/repos/tree/master)
The master branch. Used for nothing in perticular.
* [applications](https://github.com/Medoric/repos/tree/applications)
For keeping applications like .exe, .msi files etc.
* [compressed-files](https://github.com/Medoric/repos/tree/compressed-files)
For keeping compressed files like .zip, .rar, .7z files etc.
* [documents](https://github.com/Medoric/repos/tree/documents)
For keeping documents. There are some special documents including .txt files (text documents) and .ppt, .xls files (Microsoft Office documents, presentations and spreadsheets). Other files like .json are also kept in the `documents` branch.
* [miscellaneous](https://github.com/Medoric/repos/tree/miscellaneous)
For keeping other kinds of files that doesn't seem much appropriate to keep in the other braches.
* [source-codes](https://github.com/Medoric/repos/tree/source-codes)
For keeping the source codes of some C++ programs (the programming language I'm currently using). They are not currently kept in the `documents` branch but I'm going to merge them later.
