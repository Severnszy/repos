# README for Repository `repos`
## Description of the repository
This is my first repository. It is used to keep different kinds of files, kept in separate braches, for instance documents are kept in the `documents` branch. Descriptions of each branch are as follows:
* [master](https://github.com/medoric/repos/tree/master)
The master branch. Used for nothing in perticular.
* [applications](https://github.com/medoric/repos/tree/applications)
For keeping applications like `.exe`, `.msi` files etc.
* [compressed-files](https://github.com/medoric/repos/tree/compressed-files)
For keeping compressed files like `.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z` files etc.
* [documents](https://github.com/medoric/repos/tree/documents)
For keeping documents. There are some special documents including .txt files (text documents) and `.ppt`, `.xls` files (Microsoft Office documents, presentations and spreadsheets). Other files like `.json` are also kept in the `documents` branch.
* [miscellaneous](https://github.com/medoric/repos/tree/miscellaneous)
For keeping other kinds of files that doesn't seem much appropriate to keep in the other braches.
* [source-codes](https://github.com/medoric/repos/tree/source-codes)
For keeping the source codes of some C++ programs (the programming language I'm currently using). They are not currently kept in the `documents` branch but I'm going to merge them later.

## Note
This is not a repository for keeping a certain project, it's just used for keeping all kings of files that doesn't have anything to do with each other. So even if you do want to download, don't download every file in the repos.

## And a "hello world" program
This is a "hello world" program! (For anyone who still can't write it.)
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    cout << "Hello world!!\n";
    return 0;
}
```
